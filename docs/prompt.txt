You are a consumer psychologist and market research expert. Generate a comprehensive, 
        data-informed psychographic profile based on established behavioral research patterns.
        
        CONTEXT:
        Industry: Savannah's Urban Lifestyle Enthusiasts
        Demographics: Age: 25-40 | Gender: All | Income: Middle to Upper Middle Income
        Campaign Brief: {brief_text[:1000]}
        
        Generate a detailed psychographic profile using these frameworks:
        - Values: Schwartz Value Theory (with QVI scores 0-100)
        - Personality: Big Five Model traits
        - Lifestyle: Activities, Interests, Opinions (AIO framework)
        - Media: Based on Savannah's Urban Lifestyle Enthusiasts industry consumption patterns
        
        IMPORTANT: Base your analysis on:
        1. Established demographic-psychographic correlations
        2. Industry-specific consumer behavior patterns  
        3. Generational cohort characteristics
        4. Geographic and cultural influences
        5. Income-lifestyle relationships
        
        Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
        {
  "demographics": [
    <string> # percentage of gender
    <string> # percentage of age range
    <string> # percentage of income range
    <string> # percentage of maritial status
    <string> # percentage of people who do no have children under 18
  ],
  "values": [
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }, # should be above 100 and max 4 
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }
  ],
  "psychological_drivers": [
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }], # should be above 100 and max 4 
  "activities": [
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }, # should be above 100 and max 4 
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> },
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }
  ],
  "daily_routines": [
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }, # should be above 100 and max 4 
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> },
    { "trait": <string> "qvi": <integer> }
  ]
}

        
        Ensure all insights are:
        - Consistent with the demographic profile
        - Supported by behavioral research patterns
        - Specific and actionable (not generic)
        - Internally coherent (values align with activities, etc.)



Attaching an example. Strictly follow the pattern:
{
  "demographics": [
    "100% are Female",
    "22% are 35-44 Years of Age",
    "61% with Some College",
    "36% are Single",
    "49% do not have Children Under Age 18"
  ],
  "values": [
    { "trait": "Freedom to Be Creative", "qvi": 332 },
    { "trait": "Everyone Treated Equally", "qvi": 185 }
  ],
  "psychological_drivers": [{ "trait": "Devotion to God/Faith", "qvi": 179 }],
  "activities": [
    { "trait": "Exercising Regularly", "qvi": 131 },
    { "trait": "Apparel Shopping", "qvi": 131 },
    { "trait": "Regularly Played Mobile", "qvi": 128 }
  ],
  "daily_routines": [
    { "trait": "Prayer Important Part of Day", "qvi": 185 },
    { "trait": "Life Grounded in Religion", "qvi": 180 },
    { "trait": "Avoid Drinking Soda", "qvi": 171 }
  ]
}


For all the demographics, don't add both views. Instead of: "46% are Single, 54% are Married or in Long-Term Partnerships". Do: "46% are Single"
