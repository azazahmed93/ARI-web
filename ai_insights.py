        You are a digital media buying and audience segmentation expert specializing in omnichannel advertising platforms.
        
        Based on the following marketing campaign information and Audience Resonance Index scores,
        identify 3 key audience segments for targeted omnichannel digital advertising with specific platform targeting parameters.
        
        IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
        1. Focus on OMNICHANNEL digital advertising solutions - including display, video, CTV/OTT, audio, rich media, high impact, 
           interactive, programmatic digital out-of-home (DOOH), etc.
        2. DO NOT focus on search or social media campaigns, which typically have higher CTRs than other digital channels
        3. CTR estimates should reflect realistic omnichannel expectations (typically 0.05-0.7% for display, 0.3-1.5% for video)
        4. Make sure the LAST segment is a high-growth potential audience that might not be explicitly mentioned 
           in the brief but would be valuable to target based on adjacent interests, behaviors, or demographic extensions.
           This should be a growth opportunity audience that the campaign isn't currently addressing.
        
        Campaign Information:
        {brief_text[:3000]}  # Limiting to 3000 chars to avoid token limits
        
        ARI Scores:
        {scores_str}
        
        {audience_data_str if is_siteone_hispanic else ""}
        
        For each segment, provide detailed targeting specifications for digital advertising platforms:
        1. A descriptive segment name for use in ad platforms
        2. Precise demographic targeting parameters (age ranges, gender, income brackets, etc.)
        3. Digital platform interest categories and behavior targeting options
        4. Platform-specific targeting recommendations (use generic platform types, not brand names)
        5. Key performance indicators and benchmark rates to expect for omnichannel campaigns
           - For display formats: Use CTR of 0.05-0.7%
           - For video/OTT/CTV formats: Use VCR (Video Completion Rate) of 75-85% instead of CTR
           - For audio formats: Use LTR (Listen-Through Rate) of 80-90% instead of CTR
        6. Specific media buying tactics for this segment (bid adjustments, dayparting, etc.)
        
        Format the response as a valid JSON array with objects containing:
        - name: string (descriptive segment name)
        - targeting_params: object with age_range, gender_targeting, income_targeting, education_targeting, and location_targeting
        - interest_categories: array of strings (specific interests to target in ad platforms)
        - platform_targeting: array of objects with 'platform' and 'targeting_approach' 
        - expected_performance: object with CTR (click-through rate or video completion rate for video content), CPA (cost per acquisition), and engagement_rate
        - bidding_strategy: object with bid_adjustments, dayparting, and placement_priorities
        
        Remember, make the THIRD segment a high-potential growth audience that is not currently being addressed 
        in the campaign brief but shows strong potential based on trends, adjacent interests, and market opportunities.
