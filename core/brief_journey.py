BRIEF CONTENT:
{truncated_brief}

DETECTED INDUSTRY: {industry or 'General'}

TASK: Generate complete 5-stage consumer journeys for the following 4 SPECIFIC audience segments:

AUDIENCE SEGMENTS (USE THESE EXACT NAMES):
1. **Primary**: "{audience_names['primary']}"
2. **Growth1**: "{audience_names['growth1']}"
3. **Growth2**: "{audience_names['growth2']}"
4. **Emerging**: "{audience_names['emerging']}"

For EACH audience segment, provide:
- **name**: Use the EXACT audience name provided above
- **description**: Brief description of this specific segment (1 sentence)
- **stages**: All 5 journey stages with unique content tailored to this audience

For EACH of the 5 stages in EACH audience, provide:
1. **objective**: Marketing goal for this audience at this stage (1-2 sentences)
2. **targetingStrategies**: 4 specific programmatic targeting approaches tailored to this audience
3. **creativeConcepts**: 4 messaging themes that resonate with this specific audience
4. **advertisingSolutions**: 4 tactical media recommendations suited to this audience's behavior
5. **contextInsight**: 1 data-driven insight with realistic source citation (format: "Insight (Source - Month Year)")
6. **marketSignals**: 3 relevant market trends for this audience
7. **industryNews**: 2-3 recent industry news items relevant to this audience at this stage, each with:
   - **headline**: News headline (realistic and timely)
   - **impact**: How this news affects marketing strategy for this audience at this stage (1-2 sentences)
   - **source**: News source (e.g., "TechCrunch", "Marketing Week", "AdAge")
   - **date**: Recent date (format: "Month Year", e.g., "October 2025")

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Make each audience segment DISTINCT with different behaviors, motivations, and channels
- Base audiences on the brief content and industry context
- Use programmatic advertising terminology (NO publisher names like YouTube, Meta, Google)
- Cite realistic sources like industry reports, research firms, trade publications
- Make it tactical and actionable, not generic
- Ensure content for each audience is unique and tailored to their specific characteristics

Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure (use the EXACT audience names specified above):
